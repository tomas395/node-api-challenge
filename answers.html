- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

<!-- I learned about middleware and serverside routing. -->

- [ ] Describe Middleware?

<!-- middleware is a function you can write like a function that can perform tasks like validating a user's ID for the server. It can be a global function or it can be done locally depending on what you want to do. It seems very versatile. -->

- [ ] Describe a Resource?

<!-- i was taught that everything can be considered a resource when it comes to backend, node/express. -->

- [ ] What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

<!-- you can write a status code to tell the user that it was a success. -->

- [ ] How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

<!-- it's in how you route the applications. you can compartmentalize things in your app based on how you route them.  -->
